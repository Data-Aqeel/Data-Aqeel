## 🚀 About Me  

I started my professional journey at **Tech Mahindra** in **December 2023**, where I worked as an **Associate Customer Support** in the **UPS data validation and backend process**.  
Over nearly two years (Dec 2023 – Sep 2025), I learned the power of precision, quality control, and structure in large-scale data operations.  

In **September 2025**, I decided to move forward — taking the leap to focus full-time on growing my career in **data analytics and business intelligence**.  

When I’m not analyzing data, you’ll find me in the gym 💪 — I’m a dedicated **Lifelong Fitness Practitioner** who believes in discipline, persistence, and balance. The same mindset fuels my passion for solving data problems and building analytical systems that make a difference.
